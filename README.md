# Graph-Algorithms

A Graph Algorithm is an algorithm which solves a problem in a fundamental subcategory of Mathematics, Graph Theory.

This repository features all the favorite graph algorithms. Graphs are represented in CSR format to save space which is implemented using C++.

Graphs can either be constructed from scratch using addEdge function, or can be loaded from a file that contains the list of edges.
